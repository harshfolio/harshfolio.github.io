## Hi, I'm Harsh Sharma

I'm passionate about analytics, data science, and technology. I write about using data to solve real-world problems, especially in healthcare. This is where I share learnings, tutorials, and thoughts on tech and data.

When I'm not analyzing data, you'll find me exploring new tools, reading research papers, or contributing to open-source projects.
