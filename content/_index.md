## Hi, I'm Harsh Sharma, 

I'm the founding Product Manager at Clinikally (YC S22), where I lead the e-pharmacy & digital health platform serving 3 Million Monthly users.

Outside of core product work, I also:

* Built our entire [ELT data pipeline from scratch](/posts/building-elt-pipeline-clinikally/) (BigQuery and dBt), Deployed & Setup Metabase for visualisation
* Shipped [Clara, India's first clinical-grade AI skin analysis](https://clara.clinikally.com/) that processes 14 paramnoteters in <5 seconds
* Featured by perplexity for creating an [AI catalog auditing system](https://www.perplexity.ai/api-platform/case-studies/clinikally) that flags compliance issues across 10K+ SKUs (featured by Perplexity)

I bring a researcher's rigor to product decisions. Perpetual noob that's currently learning to play the guitar. You can also send me an email [here](mailto:harshsharma12021@gmail.com)
