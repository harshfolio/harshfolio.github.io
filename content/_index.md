<h2 class="home-hero-heading">Hi, I'm <span>Harsh Sharma</span>,</h2>

I'm a Product Manager at Clinikally (YC S22), where I lead the e-pharmacy & digital health platform serving 3 Million Monthly users. Outside of core product work, I also:

* Built our entire _[ELT data pipeline from scratch](/posts/building-elt-pipeline-clinikally/)_ (BigQuery and dBt), Deployed & Setup Metabase for visualisation
* Shipped _[Clara, India's first clinical-grade AI skin analysis](https://clara.clinikally.com/_)_ that processes 14 parameters in <5 seconds
* Featured by perplexity for creating an _[AI catalog auditing engine](https://www.perplexity.ai/api-platform/case-studies/clinikally)_ that flags compliance issues across 10K+ SKUs

I bring a researcher's rigor to product decisions. Perpetual noob that's currently learning to play the guitar.
