## Hi, I'm Harsh Sharma, 

I'm the founding PM at Clinikally (YC S22), where I own our e-pharmacy & digital health platform serving 100K+ daily users. 

Outside of core product work, I also:

* [**Built** our entire ELT data pipeline from scratch (BigQuery and dBt), Deployed and setup Metabase for visualisation](/posts/building-elt-pipeline-clinikally/)
* [**Shipped** Clara, India's first clinical-grade AI skin analysis that processes 14 parameters in <5 seconds](https://clara.clinikally.com/)
* [**Created** an AI catalog auditing system that flags compliance issues across 10K+ SKUs (featured by Perplexity)](https://www.perplexity.ai/api-platform/case-studies/clinikally)
* [**Teach** myself new technical skills - from SQL to Python to (currently) guitar](#)

I bring a researcher's rigor to product decisions. Currently exploring how to scale quality healthcare through commerce, building modular platforms, and what metrics actually matter at seed stage.
