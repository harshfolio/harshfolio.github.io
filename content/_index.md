<h2 class="home-hero-heading">Hi, I'm <span>Harsh Sharma</span></h2>

I'm currently a Product Manager at Clinikally (YC S22), leading the e-pharmacy & digital health platform used by 3 million users each month. Previously I was a Public Health Researcher & Social Scientist. Outside of core product work, I also:

* Shipped _[Clara, India's first clinical-grade AI skin analysis](https://clara.clinikally.com/_)_ that processes 14 parameters in <5 seconds
* Built our entire _[ELT data pipeline from scratch](/posts/building-elt-pipeline-clinikally/)_ (BigQuery and dbt), Deployed & Setup Metabase for visualisation
* Was featured by perplexity for creating an _[AI catalog auditing engine](https://www.perplexity.ai/api-platform/case-studies/clinikally)_ that flags compliance issues across 10K+ SKUs

I bring a researcher's rigor to product decisions. Perpetual noob that's currently learning to play the guitar.
